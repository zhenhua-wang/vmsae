\title{Load Pretrained VAE Decoder}
\usage{
load_vae(model_name, save_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_name}{Character. The name of the trained VAE model (without \code{.zip} extensions).}

\item{save_dir}{Character. The directory where the trained VAE model is saved. Defaults to the current directory if \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{Decoder}, containing the decoder weights and region identifiers.
}
\description{
Load a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) decoder from disk. This function reads the saved PyTorch model weights and corresponding GEOID list, and constructs a \code{Decoder} S4 object with the loaded parameters.
}
\details{
This function assumes the model was trained and saved using \code{train_vae()}, and that the decoder weights are stored in a file compatible with \code{torch::load()} (via reticulate). It extracts the decoder input/output weights and biases, along with region GEOIDs, and returns them as an S4 object of class \code{Decoder}.
